# SNKit
Chrome Developer Tools extension for ServiceNow

## Purpose
SNKit is a devtools project dedicated to enabling quicker debugging of ServiceNow forms and Service Portal pages. The goals of the project are:

1. Establish a platform where devtools can interact with the ServiceNow page in a more meaningful way.
2. Aid in debugging ServiceNow production instances by enabling admistrators and developers to manipulate the page without making changes to the instance.
3. Enable faster analysis of ServiceNow pages leading to quicker incident resolution.
